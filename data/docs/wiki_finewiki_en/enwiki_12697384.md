# The Song of Life (1931 film)

The Song of Life (German: Das Lied vom Leben) is a 1931 German film directed by Alexis Granowsky.

## Plot
After discovering that her elderly fiancé has false teeth, a young bride-to-be becomes so distraught that she contemplates suicide. She is rescued by a young sailor, with whom she has a baby, which she eventually delivers by Caesarian section.

## Reception
This film stirred up a storm upon release for its depiction of a Caesarian birth. Though not much was really shown, it was enough to cause women filmgoers—and not a few men—to faint. The film was banned outright in Germany and ran into some censorship problems in the US; still, by its very controversial nature it proved to be a hit wherever it was shown.
