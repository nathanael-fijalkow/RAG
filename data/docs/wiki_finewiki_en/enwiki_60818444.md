As described in a film magazine review, Moore, a patrolman, is in line for a promotion but is denied it because, in the pursuit of a band of thieves, he stops to succor an injured child. He later learns of a crook bandâ€™s plan to rob the home of a banker and heads a raid against the marauders. As a result, he is made a sergeant.
