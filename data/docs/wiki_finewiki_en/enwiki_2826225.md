# Snow White (1916 film)
Snow White is a 1916 American silent romantic fantasy film directed by J. Searle Dawley. Winthrop Ames adapted it from his own 1912 Broadway play Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which was in turn adapted from the 1812 fairy tale (as collected by the Brothers Grimm). The film stars Marguerite Clark and Creighton Hale, Clark reprising her stage role.
Having seen the film at the age of fifteen, Walt Disney was inspired to use the Brothers Grimm fairy tale as the subject of his first feature-length animated film in 1937.
