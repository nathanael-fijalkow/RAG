# The Red Dragon (film)
The Red Dragon is a 1946 mystery film starring Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan, who has to sift through a host of suspects for three murders.
The film marks the first appearance of Willie Best as Chattanooga Brown, Birmingham Brown's cousin.  Compared with Mantan Moreland's appearances as Birmingham Brown, Best's portrayal of Chattanooga was broader and played more upon racial stereotypes.  The character was dropped after two appearances.
