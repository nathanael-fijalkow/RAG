Notes
1. ↑  This column includes competitive awards (i.e., Academy Awards of Merit) only.  It does not include the following: Honorary Awards; Special Awards; Special Achievement Awards; and Scientific or Technical Awards.
2. ↑  At the 1st Academy Awards  (1927–1928), Wings won the Academy Award for Outstanding Picture (now known as Best Picture), while Sunrise won the Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Picture.  At the time, these two categories were seen as equally the top award of the night, intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior film-making.  The following year, however, at the 2nd Academy Awards (1928–1929), the Academy discontinued the Unique and Artistic Picture award and decided retroactively that the Outstanding Picture award won by Wings was the highest honor that could be awarded.
3. ↑  Gone with the Wind received 8 competitive Academy Awards of Merit.  In addition, the film received a Special Award and a Scientific or Technical Award (Class III).
4. ↑  The Best Years of Our Lives received 7 competitive Academy Awards of Merit.  In addition, the film received a Special Award.
5. ↑  Oliver! received 5 competitive Academy Awards of Merit.  In addition, the film received an Honorary Award.
6. ↑  Star Wars received 6 competitive Academy Awards of Merit.  In addition, the film received a Special Achievement Award.
