## Plot
Julia, an only child of an affluent, bank owning family living in Madrid, escapes from her family to get over her grief that her boyfriend has been imprisoned. Julia is a well-educated woman, having studied in Switzerland and England, who wants to become a writer.  Julia drives to a little village in Asturias called "Corralbos del Sella" and there she stays in a mansion "llendelabarca" of an old childhood friend "Pilara" she had spent many a happy summer with.  Also living there is Pilara's mother in law Tia Gala, and her grandson Juanito.
